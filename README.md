# Traffic Light System

## Create an app that has 2 screens.

- On the first screen there is one textview which asks your car model and a button "Start Driving" which leads to the second screen.

- Add a validation check on the car model for a minimum length of 3.

- Pass the car model name to the second screen

- On the second screen the car model is displayed at the top and below there are 3 circles aligned vertically: RED, ORANGE and GREEN.

- The color intensity of the circles should change to which light is active. They should act like a real traffic light:
    - RED – 4 seconds bright
    - GREEN – 4 seconds bright
    - ORANGE – 1 second bright
    - The lights should quickly fade when turned on or off.
    - This is a classic traffic light: Green → Orange → Red and back to Green in a loop

- Make sure to test your code with unit tests
